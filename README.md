Hereâ€™s a sample README file for your notes app using React, Vue, and Django:

---

# Notes App

A simple notes application built using **React** and **Vue** for the frontend and **Django** for the backend. The app allows users to create, edit, and delete notes, and integrates with a Django REST API.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Vue.js
- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework
- **Database**: SQLite (can be replaced with PostgreSQL or other DB)
- **Authentication**: Django's built-in auth system
- **API**: RESTful API powered by Django REST Framework

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete notes.
- User authentication (sign-up, login, and logout).
- API for managing notes.
- Separate frontend apps for React and Vue (you can switch between them).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Django 4.x
- Node.js & npm/yarn
- Vue CLI

## Backend Setup (Django)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/notes-app.git
   cd notes-app/backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Apply migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. Create a superuser for admin access:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

The Django app will now be running on `http://localhost:8000`.

## Frontend Setup (React)

1. Navigate to the React frontend:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend-react
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The React app will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /api/notes/**: List all notes
- **POST /api/notes/**: Create a new note
- **PUT /api/notes/<id>/**: Update a note
- **DELETE /api/notes/<id>/**: Delete a note

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a Pull Request.
